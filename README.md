<h1>Basic Personal Website </h1>

<p>Free for anybody to copy and use for their own website if they don't want to make it themselves.</p>

<p>Note: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You will have to know how to edit stylesheets, HTML, and JavaScript </li>
  <li>I reccomend not using the about me page unless you feel comfortable using the chart.js library. (you can always remove the chart and library if you feel like it)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please notify me if you have any issues with the websites functionality.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Kado Kliewer</p>
